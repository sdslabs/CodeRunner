 getrlimit()  and  setrlimit()  get  and  set resource limits respectively.  Each resource has an associated soft and hard limit, as defined by the
       rlimit structure (the rlim argument to both getrlimit() and setrlimit()):

           struct rlimit {
               rlim_t rlim_cur;   //  Soft limit 
               rlim_t rlim_max;   //  Hard limit (ceiling for rlim_cur) 
           };

       The soft limit is the value that the kernel enforces for the corresponding resource.  The hard limit acts as a ceiling  for  the  soft  limit:  an
       unprivileged  process may only set its soft limit to a value in the range from 0 up to the hard limit, and (irreversibly) lower its hard limit.  A
       privileged process (under Linux: one with the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability) may make arbitrary changes to either limit value.

       The value RLIM_INFINITY denotes no limit on a resource (both in the structure returned by getrlimit() and in the structure passed to setrlimit()).

       resource must be one of:

       RLIMIT_AS
              The maximum size of the process's virtual memory (address space) in bytes.  This limit affects calls  to  brk(2),  mmap(2)  and  mremap(2),
              which  fail  with  the error ENOMEM upon exceeding this limit.  Also automatic stack expansion will fail (and generate a SIGSEGV that kills
              the process if no alternate stack has been made available via sigaltstack(2)).  Since the value is a long, on machines with a  32-bit  long
              either this limit is at most 2 GiB, or this resource is unlimited.

       RLIMIT_CORE
              Maximum size of core file.  When 0 no core dump files are created.  When non-zero, larger dumps are truncated to this size.

RLIMIT_CPU
              CPU time limit in seconds.  When the process reaches the soft limit, it is sent a SIGXCPU signal.  The default action for this signal is to
              terminate the process.  However, the signal can be caught, and the handler can return control to the main program.  If the process  contin‚Äê
              ues  to consume CPU time, it will be sent SIGXCPU once per second until the hard limit is reached, at which time it is sent SIGKILL.  (This
              latter point describes Linux 2.2 through 2.6 behavior.  Implementations vary in how they treat processes which continue to consume CPU time
              after  reaching  the  soft  limit.   Portable  applications that need to catch this signal should perform an orderly termination upon first
              receipt of SIGXCPU.)

       RLIMIT_DATA
              The maximum size of the process's data segment (initialized data, uninitialized data, and heap).  This limit affects calls  to  brk(2)  and
              sbrk(2), which fail with the error ENOMEM upon encountering the soft limit of this resource.

       RLIMIT_FSIZE
              The maximum size of files that the process may create.  Attempts to extend a file beyond this limit result in delivery of a SIGXFSZ signal.
              By default, this signal terminates a process, but a process can catch this signal instead, in which case the relevant  system  call  (e.g.,
              write(2), truncate(2)) fails with the error EFBIG.

       RLIMIT_LOCKS (Early Linux 2.4 only)
              A limit on the combined number of flock(2) locks and fcntl(2) leases that this process may establish.

       RLIMIT_MEMLOCK
              The  maximum  number  of  bytes of memory that may be locked into RAM.  In effect this limit is rounded down to the nearest multiple of the
              system page size.  This limit affects mlock(2) and mlockall(2) and the mmap(2) MAP_LOCKED operation.  Since Linux 2.6.9 it also affects the
              shmctl(2)  SHM_LOCK  operation,  where it sets a maximum on the total bytes in shared memory segments (see shmget(2)) that may be locked by
              the real user ID of the calling process.  The shmctl(2) SHM_LOCK locks are accounted for  separately  from  the  per-process  memory  locks
              established  by  mlock(2),  mlockall(2), and mmap(2) MAP_LOCKED; a process can lock bytes up to this limit in each of these two categories.
              In Linux kernels before 2.6.9, this limit controlled the amount of memory that could be locked by a privileged process.  Since Linux 2.6.9,
              no  limits  are placed on the amount of memory that a privileged process may lock, and this limit instead governs the amount of memory that
              an unprivileged process may lock.

 RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE (Since Linux 2.6.8)
              Specifies the limit on the number of bytes that can be allocated for POSIX message queues for the real user  ID  of  the  calling  process.
              This  limit is enforced for mq_open(3).  Each message queue that the user creates counts (until it is removed) against this limit according
              to the formula:

                  bytes = attr.mq_maxmsg * sizeof(struct msg_msg *) +
                          attr.mq_maxmsg * attr.mq_msgsize

              where attr is the mq_attr structure specified as the fourth argument to mq_open(3).

              The first addend in the formula, which includes sizeof(struct msg_msg *) (4 bytes on Linux/i386), ensures that the user  cannot  create  an
              unlimited number of zero-length messages (such messages nevertheless each consume some system memory for bookkeeping overhead).

       RLIMIT_NICE (since Linux 2.6.12, but see BUGS below)
              Specifies a ceiling to which the process's nice value can be raised using setpriority(2) or nice(2).  The actual ceiling for the nice value
              is calculated as 20 - rlim_cur.  (This strangeness occurs because negative numbers cannot be specified as resource limit values, since they
              typically have special meanings.  For example, RLIM_INFINITY typically is the same as -1.)

       RLIMIT_NOFILE
              Specifies  a  value  one  greater  than the maximum file descriptor number that can be opened by this process.  Attempts (open(2), pipe(2),
              dup(2), etc.)  to exceed this limit yield the error EMFILE.  (Historically, this limit was named RLIMIT_OFILE on BSD.)

       RLIMIT_NPROC
              The maximum number of processes (or, more precisely on Linux, threads) that can be created for the real user ID  of  the  calling  process.
              Upon encountering this limit, fork(2) fails with the error EAGAIN.

       RLIMIT_RSS
              Specifies  the limit (in pages) of the process's resident set (the number of virtual pages resident in RAM).  This limit only has effect in
              Linux 2.4.x, x < 30, and there only affects calls to madvise(2) specifying MADV_WILLNEED.

       RLIMIT_RTPRIO (Since Linux 2.6.12, but see BUGS)
              Specifies a ceiling on the real-time priority that may be set for this process using sched_setscheduler(2) and sched_setparam(2).

       RLIMIT_RTTIME (Since Linux 2.6.25)
              Specifies a limit on the amount of CPU time that a process scheduled under a real-time scheduling  policy  may  consume  without  making  a
              blocking  system call.  For the purpose of this limit, each time a process makes a blocking system call, the count of its consumed CPU time
              is reset to zero.  The CPU time count is not reset if the process continues trying to use the CPU but is preempted, its time slice expires,
              or it calls sched_yield(2).
 			  Upon  reaching the soft limit, the process is sent a SIGXCPU signal.  If the process catches or ignores this signal and continues consuming
              CPU time, then SIGXCPU will be generated once each second until the hard limit is reached, at which point the process  is  sent  a  SIGKILL
              signal.

              The intended use of this limit is to stop a runaway real-time process from locking up the system.

       RLIMIT_SIGPENDING (Since Linux 2.6.8)
              Specifies  the  limit on the number of signals that may be queued for the real user ID of the calling process.  Both standard and real-time
              signals are counted for the purpose of checking this limit.  However, the limit is only enforced for sigqueue(2); it is always possible  to
              use kill(2) to queue one instance of any of the signals that are not already queued to the process.

       RLIMIT_STACK
              The  maximum  size  of  the  process  stack,  in bytes.  Upon reaching this limit, a SIGSEGV signal is generated.  To handle this signal, a
              process must employ an alternate signal stack (sigaltstack(2)).

              Since Linux 2.6.23, this limit also determines the amount of space used for the process's command-line arguments and environment variables;
              for details, see execve(2).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EFAULT rlim points outside the accessible address space.

       EINVAL resource is not valid; or, for setrlimit(): rlim->rlim_cur was greater than rlim->rlim_max.

       EPERM  An  unprivileged process tried to use setrlimit() to increase a soft or hard limit above the current hard limit; the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capa‚Äê
              bility is required to do this.  Or, the process tried to use setrlimit() to increase the soft or hard RLIMIT_NOFILE limit above the current
              kernel maximum (NR_OPEN).
